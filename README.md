# Fodder

## Motivation

A few years ago, a certain midwestern fast-food restaurant chain discontinued its mobile app. I used their app for one specific reason: to check the **F**lavor **O**f the **D**ay (FOD). While their website still provides this information, I found it to be too slow and clunky for this one purpose. This motivated me to create an app with the goal of providing a simpler user experience.
